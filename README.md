# IoT-Based-Smart-Agriculture-Using-ESP32-and-MATLAB-IoT
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor farmland conditions using various sensors (temperature, light, humidity, soil moisture). Data is sent to a MATLAB IoT Analytics platform for real-time monitoring and automating the irrigation system.
